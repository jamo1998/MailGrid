# MailGrid

MailGrid is a React application that allows business owners to send out mass survey campaigns via email and receive real feedback from their customers! Once a survey campaign is successfully created it will render to the Dashboard, where user can see all of their active campaigns and get a better idea of what products their customers like and don't like.

**Keep in mind that once the survey is sent out, you will not be able to edit it!**

### Tracking Survey Responses

Everytime one of your recipients responds to your survey, you will be able to see if they responded with yes or no, almost immediately after they click the link.
